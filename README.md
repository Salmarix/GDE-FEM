MATLAB codes for simulating the time evolution of aerosol number distribution undergoing condensation, coagulation, removal and source processes with Finite Element Method (FEM) and Petrov-Galerkin Finite Element Method (PGFEM).
The aerosol particles can contain multiple compounds. Temporal evolutions are calculated with the Crank-Nicolson method. Code package includes support for FEM approximation for single and multicomponent GDE. 
Codes are individually commented and this documents gives an overview of the functions.

## Provided functions
Functions for the aerosol number distribution are located in the subfolder GDE_functions. Codes for the multicomponent GDE are in subfolder `multi_component`, and codes for the single component are in subfolder  `single_component `.
Short explanation for the codes are given here.

### FE matrix creation codes

### Time evolution codes 

```sh
Single component
```

- `CrankNicolsonGDE` : Crank-Nicolson mainly designed for the FEM time evolution (Should also work with difference method).

- `CrankNicolsonGDE_new` : Crank-Nicolson mainly designed for the FEM time evolution (Should also work with difference method). Implementation for the boundary conditions have been modified.  

- `discrete_GDE_solver_ver2` : Calculates solution for discrete General dynamic equation. Monomer size have to be set and a minimum particle size. 
			  	Can be used to calculate only coagulation if source is set to zero.

- `discrete_GDE_solver_final` : Calculates solution for discrete General dynamic equation. Monomer size have to be set and a minimum particle size.
